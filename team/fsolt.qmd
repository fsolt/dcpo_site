Frederick Solt is Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa. He is author and maintainer of the `DCPOtools` package and the founder of the DCPO Lab.  His other interests include comparative political behavior and political economy from a cross-national perspective. Much of his work focuses on understanding how---and why---the extent of economic inequality in a country shapes the attitudes and behavior of the people who live there. He also created and maintains the [Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID)](https://fsolt.org/swiid/), which provides the most-comparable data available on income inequality for broadly cross-national research.
