title: How is Germany treated in the SGR? Where’s East Germany?
---

Germany is West Germany only before 1991 and (united) Germany from that point forward. The CNM includes no estimates for East Germany; we just haven’t found much to include in the source data. If you know of a survey with East German data, [email us](mailto:team@dcpo.org) with the details, and we’ll be happy to get it into the next version.
