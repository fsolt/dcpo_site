    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe study of public opinion in comparative context has been hampered by data that is sparse, that is, unavailable for many countries and years; incomparable, i.e., ostensibly addressing the same issue but generated by different survey items; or, most often, both. Questions of representation and of policy feedback on public opinion, for example, cannot be explored fully from a cross-national perspective without comparable time-series data for many countries that span their respective times of policy adoption. Recent works (Claassen 2019; Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw 2019) have introduced a latent variable approach to the study of comparative public opinion that maximizes the information gleaned from available surveys to overcome issues of sparse and incomparable data and allow comparativists to examine the dynamics of public opinion. This paper advances this field of research by presenting a new model and software for estimating latent variables of public opinion from cross-national survey data that yield superior fit and more quantities of theoretical interest than previous works allow."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nDo democratic regimes depend on public support to avoid backsliding? Does public support, in turn, respond thermostatically to changes in democracy? Two prominent recent studies (Claassen 2020a, 2020b) reinvigorated the classic hypothesis on the positive relationship between public support for democracy and regime survival—and challenged its reciprocal counterpart—by using a latent variable approach to measure mass democratic support from cross-national survey data. Both studies, however, used only the point estimates of democratic support; we show that incorporating the concomitant measurement uncertainty into these analyses reveals that there is no support for either study’s conclusion. Efforts to minimize the uncertainty by incorporating additional survey data still fail to yield evidence in support of either hypothesis. These results underscore the need both for more nuanced analyses of the relationships between public support and democracy and for taking measurement uncertainty into account when working with latent variables."

Drawing on recent advances in latent variable modeling of public opinion and a comprehensive collection of survey data, we present the Public Gender Egalitarianism dataset to address this need: comparable estimates of the public’s attitudes on gender equality in the public sphere across more than one hundred countries over time.

When additional data is added for a given survey item (or, in fact, for other survey items in overlapping country-years), its difficulty and dispersion estimates may change see Woo, Goldberg, and Solt 2022, in turn influencing the PGE estimates based on responses to this survey item.

Fortunately, there’s an easy fix: the use13 command. In the command window, first type ssc install use13 to install it. Then you can type use13 pge1_0.dta, clear (change the version number as necessary, ofc) to load the PGE data.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue here is that the pge_summary.csv file is saved using RFC 4180 csv conventions, that is, with a dot marking the decimal and a comma separating values. If you are in a locale that observes different conventions—many countries use commas to indicate the decimal and semicolons to separate values—your software’s default settings may not read the data correctly. Be sure to specify the decimal marker and value delimiter appropriately when loading the file: all PGE values fall between zero and one.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use Stata’s time-series operators (l. , f. , d. , etc.), you must first declare the time and panel variables using tsset, but the PGE is already mi set, so tsset won’t work. Run the following before merging the rest of your data (called my_data.dta in this example) into the SWIID:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PGE download contains files pre-formatted for use with the tools for analyzing multiply-imputed data and other data measured with uncertainty in Stata (e.g., pge1_0.dta) or R (e.g., pge1_0.rda). This is meant to “set the default” in a way that encourages researchers to take into account the uncertainty in the PGE estimates. This uncertainty is considerable in many countries, and the tools available in both software packages can now handle pretty much any analysis one may desire (for details, read the documents R_pge.pdf and stata_pge.pdf in the PGE download). But this format does not lend itself to graphing. For this purpose, use the summary file (e.g., pge1_0_summary.csv), which presents the PGE estimates in mean-plus-standard-error summary format.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, add whatever country codes are needed to the PGE data: there are routines for both Stata (kountry; type findit kountry in Stata’s command window to install) and R (countrycode, on CRAN) to generate many commonly used country codes. Then follow the instructions for merging data into the PGE found in the “stata_pge.pdf” or “R_pge.pdf” files included in the data download.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
