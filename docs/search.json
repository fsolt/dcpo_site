    "text": "Abstract\nThe study of public opinion in comparative context has been hampered by data that is sparse, that is, unavailable for many countries and years; incomparable, i.e., ostensibly addressing the same issue but generated by different survey items; or, most often, both. Questions of representation and of policy feedback on public opinion, for example, cannot be explored fully from a cross-national perspective without comparable time-series data for many countries that span their respective times of policy adoption. Recent works (Claassen 2019; Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw 2019) have introduced a latent variable approach to the study of comparative public opinion that maximizes the information gleaned from available surveys to overcome issues of sparse and incomparable data and allow comparativists to examine the dynamics of public opinion. This paper advances this field of research by presenting a new model and software for estimating latent variables of public opinion from cross-national survey data that yield superior fit and more quantities of theoretical interest than previous works allow."

DCPO is an R package for estimating latent public opinion from cross-national survey data to maximize the information gleaned from available sources, overcome issues of missing and incomparable data, and allow comparativists to examine the dynamics of public opinion across countries.\nFor a detailed description, see the paper here.\nTo install:\n\nthe latest released version: install.packages(\"DCPO\", dependencies = TRUE)\nthe latest development version: remotes::install_github(\"fsolt/DCPO\", dependencies = TRUE)\n\nNote that DCPO depends on stan. So, please install rstan and rstantools first. See the detailed instructions here.\nWindows users may encounter some issues when installing DCPO due to the version or system settings. We recommend installing the proper version of R and Stanheaders package first.\nNote: Development of CmdStan, available on R via CmdStanR, has far outstripped that of the rstan package on which DCPO is based. DCPO estimates can now be generated much, much faster (wallclock times of < 2%) by passing the DCPO Stan file to CmdStanR. See here for an example."

The PGE estimates of public gender egalitarianism depend on the DCPO routine’s estimates of the difficulty and dispersion of each survey item. When additional data is added for a given survey item (or, in fact, for other survey items in overlapping country-years), its difficulty and dispersion estimates may change see Woo, Goldberg, and Solt 2022, in turn influencing the PGE estimates based on responses to this survey item. This means that, given the scarcity of data on Ruritania, more data can lead to substantial changes in the PGE estimates for Ruritania."
