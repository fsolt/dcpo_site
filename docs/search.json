    "text": "The study of public opinion in comparative context has been hampered by data that is sparse, that is, unavailable for many countries and years; incomparable, i.e., ostensibly addressing the same issue but generated by different survey items; or, most often, both. Questions of representation and of policy feedback on public opinion, for example, cannot be explored fully from a cross-national perspective without comparable time-series data for many countries that span their respective times of policy adoption. Recent works have introduced a latent variable approach to the study of comparative public opinion that maximizes the information gleaned from available surveys to overcome issues of sparse and incomparable data and allow comparativists to examine the dynamics of public opinion. DCPO advances this field of research by presenting a new model and software for estimating latent variables of public opinion from cross-national survey data that yield superior fit and more quantities of theoretical interest than previous works allow."

He is author and maintainer of the DCPOtools package and the founder of the DCPO Lab. His other interests include comparative political behavior and political economy from a cross-national perspective. Much of his work focuses on understanding how—and why—the extent of economic inequality in a country shapes the attitudes and behavior of the people who live there. He also created and maintains the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID), which provides the most-comparable data available on income inequality for broadly cross-national research."
